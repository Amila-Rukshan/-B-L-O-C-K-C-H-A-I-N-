This repository has a complete fully functional block-chain from scratch using java script programming. This has all the functionalities in a production level block chain like Bitcoin or Ethereum. 
These are the functionalities as a summary,
  1) Perform a proof work to secure the blockchain.
  2) Create new blocks through mining process.
  3) Create new immuatable transactions.
  4) Validate the blockchain and all block data.
  5) Retrieve addresss/transaction/block data.

There is a API to interact with our block chain fro internet and it is the main part of decentralized blockchain network. It uses a consensus alogorithm (in my case longest block chian rule) to make sure 
data is legitimate and always synchronized. It also has a simple front-end to explore the data in our blockchain.
